<title>Inferring Concept Graphs from Student Answers in MOOCs</title>  
<vision>  
If we are going to understand how students learn in MOOCs, then we need to understand how the underlying concept graph is linked to a student’s performance.

<type>  
Pilot Study
</type>  
<steps>  
<ul>
<li>
Generate concept graph and a set of questions which tests a subject’s knowledge of the concepts.
</li> <li>
Run the following experiment with ~15 people: (1) Teach the subject a subset of the concepts. (2) Record the subject’s answers to the entire question set.
</li> <li>
Try to reconstruct the underlying concept graph using the results of our experiment and compare the result with the original concept graph.
</li>
</ul>  
</steps>
